### Path 2: Test the Advanced AI Mastering Engine

```bash
# 1. Install dependencies (one time only)
pip3 install librosa soundfile scipy numpy

# 2. Analyze any audio file
python3 advanced_ai_master.py your_track.wav

# 3. Or analyze with a reference track (recommended!)
python3 advanced_ai_master.py your_track.wav --reference "Professional_Song.wav"

# 4. View results
cat advanced_analysis.json
```

**What you'll get:**
- 31-band frequency analysis
- True LUFS measurement
- Resonance detection (problem frequencies)
- Transient analysis (punchiness)
- Harmonic distortion (warmth)
- Spectral tilt (brightness)
- **Reference matching** (if reference provided):
  - Exact EQ suggestions
  - Loudness adjustment
  - Stereo width adjustment
  - Dynamics comparison

## 🎬 Example Workflow

### 1. Get a professional reference track
Download a track in your genre (e.g., "The Weeknd - Blinding Lights")

### 2. Analyze your track against it
```bash
python3 advanced_ai_master.py my_song.wav -r "Blinding_Lights.wav"
```

### 3. Read the suggestions
```
250 Hz: → Boost 2.5 dB
3150 Hz: → Boost 3.2 dB
Your LUFS: -18.2 | Reference: -14.1 | → Increase gain: 4.1 dB
Resonance at 2847 Hz → Cut 5.7 dB
```

### 4. Apply in LuvLang
- Open `luvlang_PROFESSIONAL_EQ.html`
- Load your track
- Apply EQ adjustments using the 7-band parametric EQ
- Adjust compression and limiting
- Export and re-analyze

### 5. Iterate until perfect
Keep analyzing and adjusting until your track matches the reference!
