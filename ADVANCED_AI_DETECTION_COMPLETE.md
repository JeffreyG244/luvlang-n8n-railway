## 📊 6 COMPREHENSIVE ANALYSIS CATEGORIES

### 1️⃣ ADVANCED CLIPPING DETECTION

**What It Detects:**
- ✅ **True Peak Analysis** (ITU-R BS.1770-4 compliant)
  - Simulates 4x oversampling to detect inter-sample peaks
  - Warns at 3 levels: -1.0 dBTP, -0.3 dBTP, 0 dBTP (critical)

- ✅ **Frequency-Specific Clipping**
  - Detects which frequency bands are clipping
  - Separate analysis for: Sub-Bass, Bass, Low-Mids, Mids, High-Mids, Highs

**Example Warnings:**
```
🔴 CRITICAL: Digital Clipping
True Peak: +0.8 dBTP (EXCEEDS 0 dBTP LIMIT)
💡 Solution: URGENT: Reduce gain by -3 dB immediately

🎚️ Frequency Band Saturation
Clipping detected in: Bass, Low-Mids
💡 Solution: Reduce EQ boost in Bass by -2 to -3 dB
```

---

### 2️⃣ SPECTRAL BALANCE ANALYSIS

**What It Detects:**
Uses **RMS (Root Mean Square)** calculations for accurate energy measurement across 7 frequency bands:

- ✅ **Excessive Sub-Bass** (causes rumble, loses clarity)
  - Threshold: >50% above average energy
  - Solution: HPF at 30 Hz or reduce Sub by -2 to -3 dB

- ✅ **Muddy Low-Mids** (250-500 Hz - most common mixing problem)
  - Threshold: >40% above average energy
  - Solution: Cut 300-400 Hz by -1.5 to -2.5 dB

- ✅ **Weak Mids** (vocals/melody disappear in mix)
  - Threshold: <70% of average energy
  - Solution: Boost 1-2 kHz by +1.5 to +2.5 dB

- ✅ **Harsh Sibilance** (ear fatigue)
  - Threshold: High-mids >60% above average
  - Solution: De-esser or reduce 4-6 kHz by -2 to -3 dB

- ✅ **Lacking Air/Presence** (dull sound)
  - Threshold: Air <40% of average energy
  - Solution: Boost 12-16 kHz by +1 to +2 dB

- ✅ **Excessive Brightness** (harsh/fatiguing)
  - Threshold: Highs >70% above average
  - Solution: Reduce 8-10 kHz by -2 to -3 dB

**Example Warnings:**
```
🌫️ Muddy Low-Mid Frequencies
Low-mids (250-500 Hz) are 52% excessive (lacks clarity)
💡 Solution: Cut Low-Mids by -1.5 to -2.5 dB at 300-400 Hz

🎤 Weak Midrange Presence
Mids (500-2kHz) are 35% below average (vocals hidden)
💡 Solution: Boost Mids by +1.5 to +2.5 dB at 1-2 kHz
```

### 3️⃣ DYNAMIC RANGE ANALYSIS

**What It Detects:**
Professional compression detection with broadcast standards:

- ✅ **Severe Over-Compression** (<3 dB dynamic range)
  - "Lifeless, no punch" - lost all dynamics
  - Solution: Reduce compression to 3:1-4:1 ratio

- ✅ **Heavy Compression** (3-6 dB dynamic range)
  - "Losing natural dynamics"
  - Solution: Reduce to 4:1-6:1 for more natural sound

- ✅ **Too Dynamic** (>18 dB dynamic range)
  - "May sound quiet on streaming platforms"
  - Solution: Apply gentle 2:1-3:1 compression for consistency

**Example Warnings:**
```
🗜️ CRITICAL: Severe Over-Compression
Dynamic range: 2.3 dB (lifeless, no punch)
💡 Solution: Reduce compression ratio to 3:1-4:1

📊 Very Dynamic Track
Dynamic range: 19.4 dB (may sound quiet on streaming)
💡 Solution: Consider gentle compression (2:1-3:1)
```

---

### 4️⃣ LOUDNESS OPTIMIZATION

**What It Detects:**
Streaming platform compliance (Spotify, Apple Music, YouTube):

- ✅ **Too Quiet** (<-18 LUFS)
  - Calculates exact dB difference from -14 LUFS target
  - Provides precise gain increase needed

- ✅ **Too Loud** (>-11 LUFS)
  - Warns about automatic attenuation by streaming platforms
  - Calculates how much platforms will reduce volume

- ✅ **Apple Music Style** (-13 to -11 LUFS)
  - Competitive loudness but may lack dynamics
  - Informs about platform-specific behavior

**Example Warnings:**
```
🔉 Track Below Streaming Target
-22.3 LUFS (8.3 dB below -14 LUFS Spotify target)
💡 Solution: Increase gain by +8.3 dB to reach streaming loudness

🔊 Track Too Loud (Streaming Penalty)
-9.2 LUFS (Spotify will reduce by 4.8 dB)
💡 Solution: Reduce to -11 to -14 LUFS to avoid attenuation
```

---

### 5️⃣ STEREO FIELD ANALYSIS

**What It Detects:**
L/R balance and phase issues using real stereo analyzers:

- ✅ **Stereo Imbalance** (>30% difference between L/R)
  - Detects which side is louder and by how much
  - Identifies panning problems

- ✅ **Mono Content Detection**
  - Detects tracks with little to no stereo width
  - Suggests stereo widening techniques

**Example Warnings:**
```
⚖️ Stereo Imbalance Detected
37% louder on LEFT channel (panning issue)
💡 Solution: Check stereo balance or use Mid/Side processing

📻 Mono or Narrow Stereo
Track has little stereo width (sounds centered)
💡 Solution: Add stereo widening or use stereo reverb
```

---

### 6️⃣ PROFESSIONAL QUALITY SCORE

**What It Calculates:**
Real-time quality scoring (0-100) based on all detected issues:

**Scoring System:**
- **Start:** 100 points
- **Penalties:**
  - Error: -20 points each
  - Warning: -10 points each
  - Caution: -5 points each
- **Bonuses:**
  - Optimal LUFS (-16 to -12): +10 points
  - Good dynamic range (6-12 dB): +10 points

**Quality Levels:**
- **100/100** 🏆 Broadcast-Grade Quality
- **80-99** ✅ Excellent Quality (release-ready)
- **60-79** 🟡 Good Quality (needs work)
- **0-59** 🔴 Quality Needs Improvement

**Example Scores:**
```
🏆 Broadcast-Grade Quality
Quality Score: 100/100 - Professional mastering detected!
💡 Solution: Your track meets all professional standards

✅ Excellent Quality
Quality Score: 85/100 - Very good mastering
💡 Solution: Minor improvements possible, but track is release-ready

🔴 Quality Needs Improvement
Quality Score: 45/100 - Multiple critical issues
💡 Solution: Address all errors and warnings before release
```
