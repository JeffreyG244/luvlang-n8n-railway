## 🐛 COMMON ISSUES & FIXES

### **Issue: Waveform Not Showing**
```
Check Console for:
- "Waveform canvas not found" → HTML issue
- "Canvas context not available" → Browser issue

Fix:
- Hard refresh (Cmd+Shift+R)
- Try different browser (Chrome recommended)
```

### **Issue: Spectral Analyzer Static**
```
Check:
- Is audio actually playing?
- Are frequency bars animating?
- Console shows frequency data?

Fix:
- Ensure audio is playing
- Check Web Audio setup succeeded
```

### **Issue: AI Problem Detection Shows "Analyzing..." Forever**
```
Check:
- Console for JavaScript errors
- Is frequency data available?

Fix:
- Refresh page
- Re-upload audio file
```

### **Issue: Reference Track Analysis Fails**
```
Error: "Error analyzing reference track"

Possible causes:
- Corrupted audio file
- Unsupported format
- File too large (>50MB)

Fix:
- Try different reference track
- Convert to MP3/WAV first
- Use shorter reference (30-60 seconds enough)
```

### **Issue: Bypass Button Sounds Softer**
```
This was FIXED! If it happens:

Check Console:
- Look for "💾 Saved current gain: X.XXX"
- Look for "✓ Gain restored to saved value: X.XXX"

If values are different:
- Report this as a bug!
- Should be IDENTICAL
```
