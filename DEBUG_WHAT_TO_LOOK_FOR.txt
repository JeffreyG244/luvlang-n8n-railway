🔍 DEBUG - WHAT TO LOOK FOR IN CONSOLE
==========================================

The file has been updated with extensive debug logging.

Upload audio, click Play, then check the console for these messages:

✅ SUCCESS MESSAGES (Frame 1):
-------------------------------
🔍 PEAK METER DEBUG:
  leftAnalyser exists? true/false
  rightAnalyser exists? true/false

🔍 STEREO WIDTH DEBUG:
  stereoValue element exists? true/false
  stereoCanvas element exists? true/false
  leftAnalyser exists? true/false
  rightAnalyser exists? true/false

✅ drawWaveform: Called successfully! Canvas found.
✅ drawSpectralAnalyzer: Called successfully! Canvas found.


❌ ERROR MESSAGES (if things are broken):
------------------------------------------
❌ drawWaveform: waveformCanvas element NOT FOUND
❌ drawWaveform: Could not get 2d context
❌ drawWaveform error: [error message]

❌ drawSpectralAnalyzer: spectralCanvas element NOT FOUND
❌ drawSpectralAnalyzer error: [error message]


📊 WHAT EACH MESSAGE MEANS:
============================

IF you see:
✅ drawWaveform: Called successfully!
→ Waveform function is working, canvas exists

IF you see:
✅ drawSpectralAnalyzer: Called successfully!
→ Spectral function is working, canvas exists

IF you see:
leftAnalyser exists? false
rightAnalyser exists? false
→ THIS IS THE PROBLEM! The L/R analyzers were never created
→ This means stereo width and peak meters won't work

IF you see:
leftAnalyser exists? true
rightAnalyser exists? true
→ Good! The analyzers exist, stereo width should work


COPY AND PASTE:
===============
Please copy all the console output (especially Frame 1 debug messages) and send it to me.
Look for any lines that start with ❌ or 🔍
