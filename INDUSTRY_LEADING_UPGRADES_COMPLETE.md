##### D. **Genre Detection (Machine Learning-Style)**
Analyzes patterns to classify:
- **EDM:** Heavy sub-bass (>25%), compressed (LRA <6), loud
- **Hip Hop:** Heavy bass (>40%), compressed, wide stereo
- **Rock/Metal:** High dynamic range (>10 dB), strong mids
- **Pop:** Balanced spectrum, moderate compression (LRA 6-10)

## 🎓 UNDERSTANDING THE FREQUENCY RESPONSE CURVE

### What You're Seeing
The bright green curve shows the COMBINED effect of all 7 EQ bands on your audio's frequency spectrum.

### How to Read It
- **Horizontal axis:** Frequency (20Hz - 20kHz, logarithmic scale)
- **Vertical axis:** Gain (±12dB range)
- **Center line:** 0dB (no change)
- **Above center:** Boost
- **Below center:** Cut

### Band Markers
When you adjust an EQ band, you'll see:
- **Green dot** at the band's frequency
- **Label** showing band name and gain (e.g., "Bass +3.0dB")
- **Smooth curve** connecting all bands

### Why This Matters
Professional mastering engineers use this exact visualization in Pro-Q 3, Ozone, etc. Now you have the same professional tool.
