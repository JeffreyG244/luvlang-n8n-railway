## ⚠️ TROUBLESHOOTING

### **Professional Interface**

**Problem: File won't upload**
- Check file format (WAV, MP3, FLAC, M4A, AAC, OGG)
- File size should be < 100MB
- Try a different browser

**Problem: Waveform not showing**
- Wait 1-2 seconds for processing
- Check browser console (F12) for errors
- Refresh and try again

**Problem: Nothing happens when I click play**
- Make sure you uploaded a file first
- Click anywhere on the page first (AudioContext needs user interaction)
- Check browser console for errors

### **Revolutionary Features Test**

**Problem: "Error loading engines"**
- Make sure all 4 .js files are in the same directory:
  - stem-mastering.js
  - codec-preview.js
  - podcast-suite.js
  - spectral-repair.js
- Check browser console for which file is missing
- Refresh the page

**Problem: Features show "WAITING" forever**
- Check that JavaScript files loaded (view page source)
- Look for error messages in browser console
- Make sure you're using a modern browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari)

**Problem: "Please upload a track first"**
- Upload an audio file to that specific feature section
- Wait for status to change to "LOADED"
- Then try the test button again
