# üö® PREVENTING WRONG DEPLOYMENT - LUVLANG

## THE PROBLEM
LuvLang keeps reverting to wrong versions during deployment, losing the correct professional purple/pink theme and upload features.

## ‚úÖ CORRECT VERSION (ON LOVABLE.DEV)
- **URL**: https://lovable.dev/projects/016dc165-a1fe-4ce7-adef-dbf00d3eba8a
- **Theme**: Deep purple + pink professional design
- **Hero**: "Find Your Soul Match" 
- **Features**: Photo upload, advanced routing, Supabase integration

## ‚ùå WRONG VERSIONS TO AVOID
- Vite template with "Vite + React" title
- Simple counter with "count is {count}"
- Basic pink theme without purple
- Missing photo upload functionality

## üîí PROTECTION SYSTEMS NOW IN PLACE

### 1. Version Check File
- `src/version-check.ts` automatically validates on load
- Detects Vite template artifacts
- Logs warnings if wrong version detected

### 2. Deployment Lock Files
- `.deployment-lock.json` - Configuration lock
- `DEPLOYMENT-LOCK.md` - Human-readable checklist
- Protection against accidental wrong deployments

### 3. Build Process Guards
- Version validation before build
- Automated checking of key files
- Fail-safe mechanisms

## üìã MANUAL VERIFICATION CHECKLIST

Before ANY deployment, verify:

1. **Hero Section** (`src/components/home/HeroSection.tsx`):
   ```tsx
   Find Your <span className="text-transparent bg-clip-text bg-gradient-to-r from-love-primary to-love-secondary">Soul Match</span>
   ```

2. **CSS Theme** (`src/index.css`):
   ```css
   --love-primary: 280 100% 70%;
   --love-secondary: 320 100% 75%;
   ```

3. **Photo Upload** (`src/components/SimplePhotoCapture.tsx`):
   - File must exist and be functional

4. **App Router** (`src/App.tsx`):
   - Must have advanced routing
   - NO Vite template code

## üîÑ RECOVERY PROCESS

If wrong version is deployed:

1. **STOP** any further deployments
2. Go to Lovable.dev project: `016dc165-a1fe-4ce7-adef-dbf00d3eba8a`
3. Copy the correct code from Lovable
4. Replace local files with correct version
5. Run validation: `npm run validate` (when working)
6. Only deploy after ALL checks pass

## üöÄ SAFE DEPLOYMENT STEPS

1. Verify current version is correct locally
2. Check all validation files are present
3. Run build to ensure no errors
4. Deploy only after verification
5. Immediately check deployed site matches expected design
